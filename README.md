<h1> Assignment Instructions </h1>

Place your solutions to each of the tasks in the Script.js file. You should be utilizing the chrome dev tools or running the " node script.js " command in your terminal to check your outputs.




<h3> Tasks </h3>

<h2> Task 1: Variables </h2>

1. Declare a variable to store your name as a string.
2. Declare a variable to store your age as a number.
3. Use console.log() to print a sentence like: "My name is [your name] and I am [your age] years old."

<h2> Task 2: Data Types </h2>

Create variables to store examples of the following data types:
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. null
5. undefined

Experiment with the typeof operator in the console to verify the data type of each variable.

<h2> Task 3: Operators </h2>

Perform the following calculations and log the results to the console:
Add two numbers together.
Divide one number by another.
Use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of a division.
Compare two numbers using a comparison operator and log a message indicating if they are equal or not.

<h2> Task 4: Conditionals </h2>

Write an if...else statement to check if your age (from Task 1) is above the legal driving age (set it to 16 for this example). Print an appropriate message to the console.
Chain an else if statement to your code from the previous step. This time, check if the age is below 10. If so, print a different message to the console.


<h3>Optional Challenge: Nested Conditionals</h3>

Expand your conditional logic to handle a broader range of ages. Add more else if statements to display messages like "Eligible for a learner's permit" or, playfully, "Too young to drive... maybe try a bicycle?".


<h1> Submission (optional)</h1>

<h3>How to Create a Pull Request</h3>

To create a pull request, follow these steps:

## Fork the Repository:

Navigate to the original repository you wish to contribute to.
Click the "Fork" button (usually found in the top-right corner). This creates a copy of the repository under your own account.

## Clone Your Fork:

Copy the URL of your forked repository.
Use a Git client or command line to clone the forked repository to your local computer. For example: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forked-repo.git

## Create a Branch:

Switch to a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized and separated from the main branch (master or main) of your fork.
For example: git checkout -b my-feature-branch

## Make Your Changes:

Edit the relevant files in your local copy of the code.
Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. git add . git commit -m "Added a new feature to improve readability"

## Push to Your Fork:

Push the changes on your branch to your forked repository on GitHub. git push origin my-feature-branch

## Submit the Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
A banner may appear notifying you of your recent changes and offering to create a pull request. If not, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab.
Click "New pull request."
Carefully choose the base branch (the original repository's branch) and the compare branch (your feature branch).
Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes.
Click "Create pull request."
