## Task 1: Variables

1. Declare a variable to store your name as a string.

2. Declare a variable to store your age as a number.

3. Use console.log() to print a sentence like: "My name is [your name] and I am [your age] years old."

## Task 2: Data Types

Create variables to store examples of the following data types:
String
Number
Boolean
null
undefined
Experiment with the typeof operator in the console to verify the data type of each variable.

## Task 3: Operators

Perform the following calculations and log the results to the console:
Add two numbers together.
Divide one number by another.
Use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of a division.
Compare two numbers using a comparison operator and log a message indicating if they are equal or not.

## Task 4: Conditionals

Write an if...else statement to check if your age (from Task 1) is above the legal driving age (set it to 16 for this example). Print an appropriate message to the console.
Chain an else if statement to your code from the previous step. This time, check if the age is below 10. If so, print a different message to the console.
Optional Challenge: Nested Conditionals

Expand your conditional logic to handle a broader range of ages. Add more else if statements to display messages like "Eligible for a learner's permit" or, playfully, "Too young to drive... maybe try a bicycle?".
